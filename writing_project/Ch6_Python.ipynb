When we put it on randomize, after it plays a song from a CD it randomly chooses another CD, with each CD equally likely to be chosen (including the CD currently being played). We play 10 songs with the randomizer on and all 6 CD slots filled. (1) How many possibilities are there for which CDs are chosen? (2) How many of these possibilities never have CD 2, 3 or 6 played, or, equivalently, what is the probability that we never hear a song from CD 2, 3 or 6?

    "_Imagine we live in a state where license plates for cars are constructed according to the following rules: all license plates start with three letters (and each letter is equally likely to be chosen) followed by three numbers (and all numbers are equally likely to be chosen). (1) How many different license plates are there? (2) Assume now that we’re not allowed to have any vowels (A, E, I, O or U) or any even numbers. How many license plates are there? (3) What’s the probability two people have exactly four of their six digits equal?_\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 3\n",
    "To have exactly four of six digits (a digit is one of the symbols on the license plate, i.e., either one of the three numbers or letters) equal is to say that exactly two of six digits are different. There are $\\binom{6}{2} = 15$ ways exactly two digits can be different. Why? We have to pick two of the six digits to differ; this is the definition of the binomial coefficient. Because some digits are numbers and others are letters, and numbers have a smaller pool of to pick from than letters, we evaluate this on a case-by-case basis. Adding up each case will give us the total number of ways in which two license plates can have exactly four digits equal. We list the fifteen possible ways for two digits from six to be chosen: (1) two letters: first and second, first and third, second and third; (2) two numbers: fourth and fifth, fourth and sixth, fifth and six; (3) a letter and a number: first and fourth, first and fifth, first and sixth, second and fourth, second and fifth, second and sixth, third and fourth, third and fifth, third and sixth. We’ll see below that all pairs in each class give the same contribution. _Keep the following in mind as you read the analysis below: if we are trying to find how often two license plates agree in exactly four places, this is the same as fixing one license plate and asking how often a randomly chosen second plate matches it in exactly four places._ After our first approach we’ll see how this insight speeds up the calculation. __The naive simulation:__"

    "_Imagine we have four jars. In each jar there are 100 marbles, and each marble is either purple or gold. The first jar has exactly 10 purple marbles, the second exactly 30 purple marbles, the third exactly 60 purple marbles, and the last exactly 90 purple marbles. (1): Assume we draw 5 marbles from the first jar: what is the probability that we have at least four purple marbles? (2), (3) and (4): Repeat this for the other three jars. (5): If we were to choose a jar at random, what is the probability we have at least four purple marbles when we draw five?_\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated, the problem is too vague to solve. What does it mean to draw 5 marbles from a jar? Are we pulling out five marbles one at at time, or are we pulling out a marble, recording its color, replacing it, and then pulling a marble out again? Not surprisingly, the two methods lead to two different answers. The first is called __sampling without replacement__, while the second is called __sampling with replacement__. We first describe the solution when we sample without replacement, and then with. For many problems, sampling without replacement is more natural; a great example are lotteries, where numbers cannot be repeated. However, there are times when we do have replacement (such as sampling points for Monte Carlo integration), so it’s important to be able to do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 1-4 (without replacement)\n",
    "Let’s consider the first jar (Question 1), with 10 purple marbles\n",
    "and 90 gold ones. There are two ways we can draw at least four purple marbles:\n",
    "by drawing exactly four purple marbles and one gold one, or by drawing five purple marbles. We add up the probability of each case to find the probability of either case, and thus the probability of at least four purple marbles. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First consider the case of drawing 5 purple marbles. When drawing the first, there are ten purple marbles to pick out of a total one hundred, so the probability is 10/100. Once we’ve picked out the first purple marble, though, there are only nine purple ones out of a total ninety-nine left. The probability of having a purple marble on the second pick (given a purple marble on the first pick) is 9/99. The probabilities of the remaining three marbles being purple are 8/98, 7/97, and 6/96 respectively. Multiplying all these probabilities together, we find the probability of drawing five purple marbles is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{9}{99} \\cdot \\frac{8}{98} \\cdot \\frac{7}{97} \\cdot \\frac{6}{96} = \\frac{30,240}{9,034,502,400} =\\frac{1}{298,760}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next we calculate the probability of drawing four purple marbles and one gold one. Note that there are five possible ways this can happen: if the gold marble is picked first and the remaining four marbles are purple; if the gold marble is picked second and the other four are purple; and so on. We must add up all these probabilities. First suppose the gold marble was picked first. The probability of picking out a gold marble is 90/100. With ten purple marbles still in the bag but only 99 total marbles remaining, the probability of the second marble being purple is 10/99. With similar reasoning from above, we see that the probabilities of picking the remaining purple marbles are 9/98, 8/97, and 7/96. Thus we can calculate the probability of picking out one gold marble followed by four purple marbles:\n",
    "$$\\frac{90}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{99} \\cdot \\frac{9}{98} \\cdot \\frac{8}{97} \\cdot \\frac{7}{96} = \\frac{453,600}{9,034,502,400} =\\frac{3}{59,752}$$\n",
    "Notice that this is the same exact probability as drawing the gold marble first.\n",
    "This is no coincidence. Consider the denominators of both products: they are\n",
    "identical, because no matter which marble we select, we’re always reducing\n",
    "the number of marbles in the jar by one. In the numerator, because we’re always\n",
    "picking out one gold marble and four purple ones without replacement,\n",

    "We now solve the problem with replacement. This means that marbles are picked one at a time, and each time a marble is selected, the choice is noted and the marble is placed back in the jar before selecting the next marble. We’ll see that this somewhat simplifies our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution to Question 1 with replacement. The first jar has 10 purple marbles and 90 gold ones. As when drawing marbles without replacement, there are two ways we can draw at least four purple marbles: by drawing exactly four purple marbles (and one gold one) or exactly five purple marbles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We now calculate the probability of drawing five purple marbles. Since there are ten purplemarbles out of a possible hundred, the probability of drawing the first marble is 10/100. Indeed, since each marble is replaced, the probability of drawing each purple marble is 10/100. Thus the probability of drawing all five purple marbles equals:\n",
    "$$\\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} = (\\frac{1}{10})^5 = \\frac{1}{100,000}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- We now need to find the probability of drawing four purple marbles and one gold one. Again, the same analysis we used on drawing marbles without replacement follows here: we need to take into account that the gold marble may be picked first, second, third, fourth, or fifth; but the probability of each of these events is equal, so we can calculate the probability of all of these events by multiplying the probability of one of them by five. Without loss of generality, suppose we select the gold marble first. There are 90 gold marbles, so the probability will be 90/100. Next we select a purple marble. Since the first marble was replaced, there are ten purple out of a total of 100 marbles, so the probability of the marble being purple is 10/100. Since this second marble is also replaced, the probability of drawing each of the three remaining purple purple marbles will also be 10/100. The probability of drawing a gold marble followed by four purple marbles, then, is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{90}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{100} = \\frac{9}{10} \\cdot (\\frac{1}{10})^4 = \\frac{9}{100,000}$$\n",
    "Recalling that we must multiply this value by five (as there are $\\binom{5}{1}$ 5 ways to choose one position to be gold) to find the probability of drawing four purple marbles and one gold marble, we get:\n",
    "$$5 \\cdot \\frac{9}{100,000} = \\frac{9}{20,000}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the probability of drawing at least four purple marbles is the probability of drawing exactly four or exactly five purple marbles:\n",
    "\n",
