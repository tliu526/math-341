    "_Imagine we have four jars. In each jar there are 100 marbles, and\n",

The first jar has exactly 10 purple marbles, the second exactly 30 purple marbles, the third exactly 60 purple marbles, and the last exactly 90 purple marbles. (1): Assume we draw 5 marbles from the first jar: what is the probability that we have at least four purple marbles? (2), (3) and (4): Repeat this for the other three jars. (5): If we were to choose a jar at random, what is the probability we have at least four purple marbles when we draw five?_\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated, the problem is too vague to solve. What does it mean to draw 5 marbles from a jar? Are we pulling out five marbles one at at time, or are we pulling out a marble, recording its color, replacing it, and then pulling a marble out again? Not surprisingly, the two methods lead to two different answers. The first is called __sampling without replacement__, while the second is called __sampling with replacement__. We first describe the solution when we sample without replacement, and then with. For many problems, sampling without replacement is more natural; a great example are lotteries, where numbers cannot be repeated. However, there are times when we do have replacement (such as sampling points for Monte Carlo integration), so it’s important to be able to do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 1-4 (without replacement)\n",
    "Let’s consider the first jar (Question 1), with 10 purple marbles\n",
    "and 90 gold ones. There are two ways we can draw at least four purple marbles:\n",
    "by drawing exactly four purple marbles and one gold one, or by drawing five purple marbles. We add up the probability of each case to find the probability of either case, and thus the probability of at least four purple marbles. \n",
    "\n",
    "- First consider the case of drawing 5 purple marbles. When drawing the first, there are ten purple marbles to pick out of a total one hundred, so the probability is 10/100. Once we’ve picked out the first purple marble, though, there are only nine purple ones out of a total ninety-nine left. The probability of having a purple marble on the second pick (given a purple marble on the first pick) is 9/99. The probabilities of the remaining three marbles being purple are 8/98, 7/97, and 6/96 respectively. Multiplying all these probabilities together, we find the probability of drawing five purple marbles is:\n",
    "$$\\frac{10}{100} \\cdot \\frac{9}{99} \\cdot \\frac{8}{98} \\cdot \\frac{7}{97} \\cdot \\frac{6}{96} = \\frac{30,240}{9,034,502,400} =\\frac{1}{298,760}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next we calculate the probability of drawing four purple marbles and one gold one. Note that there are five possible ways this can happen: if the gold marble is picked first and the remaining four marbles are purple; if the gold marble is picked second and the other four are purple; and so on. We must add up all these probabilities. First suppose the gold marble was picked first. The probability of picking out a gold marble is 90/100. With ten purple marbles still in the bag but only 99 total marbles remaining, the probability of the second marble being purple is 10/99. With similar reasoning from above, we see that the probabilities of picking the remaining purple marbles are 9/98, 8/97, and 7/96. Thus we can calculate the probability of picking out one gold marble followed by four purple marbles:\n",
    "$$\\frac{90}{100} \\cdot \\frac{10}{99} \\cdot \\frac{9}{98} \\cdot \\frac{8}{97} \\cdot \\frac{7}{96} = \\frac{453,600}{9,034,502,400} =\\frac{3}{59,752}$$\n",
    "Notice that this is the same exact probability as drawing the gold marble first.\n",
    "This is no coincidence. Consider the denominators of both products: they are\n",
    "identical, because no matter which marble we select, we’re always reducing\n",
    "the number of marbles in the jar by one. In the numerator, because we’re always\n",
    "picking out one gold marble and four purple ones without replacement,\n",
    "we see the same numbers only in different orders. Because multiplication is\n",
    "commutative, we always arrive at the same result: a probability of 3 in 59,752.\n",
    "Since there are $\\binom{5}{1} = 5$ ways to draw one gold marble and four purple ones (the gold marble first, second, third, fourth, or fifth), we can multiply this probability by five to find the probability of selecting exactly four purple marbles: $\\text{P}(4 \\text{ purple})= 5 \\cdot \\frac{3}{59,752} = \\frac{15}{59,752}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we initially discussed, the probability of selecting at least four purple marbles is equal to the probability of selecting exactly four or exactly five purple marbles. Thus the probability of selecting at least four purple marbles is $\\frac{1}{298,760} + \\frac{15}{59,752} = \\frac{19}{74,690}$ or about a .025% probability.\n",
