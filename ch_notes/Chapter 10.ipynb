Let $g : I \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a differentiable function with inverse $h$, and assume the derivative of $g$ is either always positive or always negative in $I$, except at finitely may points where it may be zero. If we let $Y = g(X)$, then:\n",

    "- We want $g$ to be differentiable.\n",
    "- We want to the derivative of $g$ to be either always positive or always negative. This implies that $g$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. As a consequence, we find that each value of $X$ is associated with a uniqe value of $Y$ and vice-versa. Note that the derivative of $g$ can vanish so long as it has the same sign immediately before and after.\n",
