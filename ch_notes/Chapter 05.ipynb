Since there is only one red shirt: $5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 15$. Note here that we have double counted outfits with both red socks and red shirts. So we calculate the number of outfits with both and subtract that out. Two pairs of red socks, one red shirt: $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 = 6$ outfits with both a red shirt and red socks. Thus the final amount is $24 - 15 - 6 = 33$. \n",

The number of ways that D can be put into position 4 is $3! = 6$. The number of ways both A goes first and D goes last is $2! = 2$.
